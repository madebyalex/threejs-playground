        Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and
        display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. It runs in all
        browsers, and is built on top of WebGL (Web Graphics Library), another
        JavaScript API for rendering 3D graphics within any compatible web
        browser without the use of plug-ins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Three.js is one of many popular high-level libraries to create complex
        3D computer animations that display in the browser without any
        traditional browser applications or plugins.
