It runs in all browsers, and is built on top of WebGL (Web Graphics Library), another JavaScript API for rendering 3D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins.</p><p>Three.js is one of many popular high-level libraries to create complex 3D computer animations that display in the browser without any traditional browser applications or plugins.</p><p>Three.js was first released by Ricardo Cabello to GitHub in April 2010.[2] The origins of the library can be traced back to his involvement with the demoscene in the early 2000s. The code was first developed in ActionScript and ported to JavaScript in 2009. In Cabello's mind, the two strong points for the transfer to JavaScript were not having to compile the code before each run and platform independence. With the advent of WebGL, Paul Brunt was able to add the renderer for this quite easily as Three.js was designed with the rendering code as a module rather than in the core itself. Cabello's contributions include API design, CanvasRenderer, SVGRenderer, and being responsible for merging the commits by the various contributors into the project.</p><p>Branislav Uličný, an early contributor, started with Three.js in 2010 after having posted a number of WebGL demos on his own site. He wanted WebGL renderer capabilities in Three.js to exceed those of CanvasRenderer or SVGRenderer. His major contributions generally involve materials, shaders, and post-processing.</p><p>Soon after the introduction of WebGL 1.0 on Firefox 4 in March 2011, Joshua Koo came on board. He built his first Three.js demo for 3D text in September 2011. His contributions frequently relate to geometry generation.</p><p>Michael Herzog became an active contributor in late 2015. He is the second greatest contributor in terms of commits, behind Ricardo Cabello.</p><p>There are over 1300 contributors on GitHub.</p></main><canvas class="webgl"></canvas></body></html>
