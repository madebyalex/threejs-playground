        <h1>Conquer the mountains</h1>
        <p>
          Mountain hiking embodies what hiking is all about: breathtaking views,
          fresh air, and a good workout. Hiking in the mountains is probably the
          most healthy vacation possible. Beyond the exercise there's also
          health-benefits like zero stress, like fresh air, clean water and
          friendship.
